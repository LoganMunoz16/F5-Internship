## NSure
Project NSure is a web application designed to reduce the complexity of NGINX configuration to increase marketability to small or medium sized businesses. My intern cohort and I served as front-end developers on a global team consisting of members from the US, India, and Germany. Since my internship has ended, I do not have access to the codebase for NSure any longer. However, the following is a list of the different tasks that I personally completed for their respective releases.
