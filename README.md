## Overview
The following is a calendar giving a full overview of my intern cohort's activities throughout the internship, and progress made on Project NSure.

## NSure
Project NSure is a web application designed to reduce the complexity of NGINX configuration to increase marketability to small or medium sized businesses. My intern cohort and I served as front-end developers on a global team consisting of members from the US, India, and Germany. Since my internship has ended, I do not have access to the codebase for NSure any longer. However, the following is a list of the different tasks that I personally completed for their respective releases.


-  Release Aachen
    -  Login/Register System
    -  Re-configure a page displaying applications connected to the NGINX instance
    -  Added a type field for each application

-  Release Berlin/Cologne
    - Full refactoring of state management
    - UI/UX for a drawer to customize application protections
    - Updated UI for adding an application


Another large piece of Project NSure came in the form of presentations. Most notably, F5 holds a Learning Day once a quarter, where employees are encouraged to take a break from their usual projects to learn something new. Our intern teams were tasked with creating a video presentation to display at a Virtual Fair on this day. This was a test of our presentation skills, and our ability to talk with VIPs about the specifics of Project NSure when handling questions from those in attendance. Below is the poster for the Learning Day we presented at, which doubled as our Zoom background as presenters.

## Hackathon
In week 4 of my internship, the Greenhouse held an intern hackathon. All interns were flown in to the Seattle office, and given a day and a half to form groups and create an application geared toward social change. My group consisted of 5 interns, and we created a web application entitled Food Bank Food App. The application allowed users to submit descriptions of food they would like to donate to a nearby organization, and a text would be sent with that user's address and donation information to any nearby delivery drivers for the organization in question. Food Bank Food App took inspiration from services such as Amazon Fresh, and aimed to make it more convenient for people to donate food in the hopes of encouraging a higher volume of donations. 


Along with this application, we also had to create a short pitch/presentation on Food Bank Food App to enter into a contest with the other intern groups. The panel of judges from around the company fortunately decided that our application had the most potential, and we won first prize out of all intern groups. Access to this codebase has also been removed, but the following image is another Zoom background that was given to all interns for participating in that competition.
